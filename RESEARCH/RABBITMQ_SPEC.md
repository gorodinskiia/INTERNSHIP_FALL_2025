# Feature Specification: RabbitMQ Messaging System

**Feature Branch**: `002-rabbitmq-messaging`
**Created**: 2025-01-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Implement comprehensive RabbitMQ messaging with multiple exchange patterns"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic Producer/Consumer (Priority: P1)

System should support basic message publishing and consumption for simple queue operations.

**Why this priority**: Foundation for all other messaging patterns

**Independent Test**: Can be tested with simple send/receive operations independently

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** producer sends message to queue, **When** consumer is listening, **Then** message received and processed
2. **Given** multiple messages sent, **When** single consumer processes, **Then** messages handled in order
3. **Given** consumer processes message, **When** acknowledgment sent, **Then** message removed from queue

---

### User Story 2 - Direct Exchange Routing (Priority: P1)

System should route messages based on exact routing keys for point-to-point communication.

**Why this priority**: Essential for task distribution and log processing systems

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by sending messages with different routing keys to appropriate consumers

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** message sent with routing key "task.email", **When** consumer bound to "task.email", **Then** only that consumer receives message
2. **Given** message sent with routing key "log.error", **When** consumer bound to "log.error", **Then** error consumer receives message
3. **Given** message sent with unmatched routing key, **When** no consumer bound, **Then** message handled by dead letter exchange

---

### User Story 3 - Topic Exchange Patterns (Priority: P2)

System should support pattern-based routing with wildcards for flexible message distribution.

**Why this priority**: Enables complex event-driven architectures with hierarchical routing

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by sending messages with various patterns and verifying correct consumer receives

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** message sent with "analytics.user.login", **When** consumer bound to "analytics.*.*", **Then** analytics consumer receives message
2. **Given** message sent with "user.create.account", **When** consumer bound to "*.create.*", **Then** creation events consumer receives message
3. **Given** message sent with "system.error.database", **When** consumer bound to "*.error.*", **Then** error consumer receives message

---

### User Story 4 - Fanout Broadcasting (Priority: P2)

System should broadcast messages to all bound consumers for notification systems.

**Why this priority**: Critical for system-wide notifications and cache invalidation

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by sending broadcast message and verifying all consumers receive copies

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** message broadcast to fanout exchange, **When** multiple consumers bound, **Then** all consumers receive message
2. **Given** system alert sent, **When** all services listening, **Then** all services process alert
3. **Given** cache invalidation message, **When** multiple services bound, **Then** all services clear cache

---

### User Story 5 - RPC Request-Response (Priority: P3)

System should support request-response pattern for service-to-service communication.

**Why this priority**: Enables synchronous-like communication over asynchronous messaging

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by sending RPC request and verifying response received

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** RPC request sent to math service, **When** calculation requested, **Then** correct result returned
2. **Given** RPC request sent to user service, **When** user data requested, **Then** user information returned
3. **Given** RPC request times out, **When** no response received, **Then** timeout error returned

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST support basic queue operations (send/receive/acknowledge)
- **FR-002**: System MUST implement direct exchange with routing key matching
- **FR-003**: System MUST implement topic exchange with wildcard patterns (*, #)
- **FR-004**: System MUST implement fanout exchange for broadcasting
- **FR-005**: System MUST support RPC pattern with correlation IDs
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle message persistence and durability
- **FR-007**: System MUST support consumer acknowledgments and requeuing
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide connection recovery and error handling

### Key Entities

- **Message**: Data payload with headers, properties, and routing information
- **Queue**: Ordered collection of messages for consumer processing
- **Exchange**: Routing mechanism that distributes messages to queues
- **Binding**: Connection between exchange and queue with routing rules
- **Connection**: Network connection to RabbitMQ server
- **Channel**: Virtual connection within a connection for isolation

### Performance Requirements

- **PR-001**: System MUST handle 1000 messages per second per queue
- **PR-002**: Message delivery MUST complete within 100ms for local connections
- **PR-003**: Connection recovery MUST complete within 5 seconds
- **PR-004**: System MUST maintain 99.9% uptime for message processing

### Reliability Requirements

- **RR-001**: Messages MUST be persisted to disk for durability
- **RR-002**: Failed messages MUST be requeued up to 3 times
- **RR-003**: Dead letter exchanges MUST handle permanently failed messages
- **RR-004**: Connection failures MUST trigger automatic reconnection

## Technical Stack

- **Message Broker**: RabbitMQ 3.x with management plugin
- **Client Libraries**: amqplib (Node.js), pika (Python)
- **Connection Management**: Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- **Message Patterns**: Direct, Topic, Fanout, Headers, RPC
- **Persistence**: Durable queues and persistent messages
- **Monitoring**: RabbitMQ Management API and health checks

## Exchange Types

| Exchange Type | Routing Method | Use Case | Performance |
|---------------|----------------|----------|-------------|
| **Direct** | Exact key match | Task distribution, logging | High |
| **Topic** | Pattern matching | Event systems, categorization | High |
| **Fanout** | Broadcast | Notifications, cache invalidation | High |
| **Headers** | Header matching | Complex routing logic | Medium |

## Success Metrics

- **SM-001**: 99.99% of messages delivered successfully
- **SM-002**: Zero message loss in normal operation
- **SM-003**: All exchange patterns working correctly
- **SM-004**: Documentation covers all implemented patterns
